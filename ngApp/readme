**** To get the build running  ****

When you want to pull this down you do a npm install then and then an ng serve to build the project

You got to http://localhost:4200 to see the current build

**** After you have pushed or made changes ****

Once a build is ready you do an ng build then copy over the dist folder to the AWS

Once copied over refresh the website and app-pool and it should be up and running again
