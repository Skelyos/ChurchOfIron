**** To get the build running  ****

When you want to pull this down you do a node server to start the server

Then go to http://localhost:3000 to see the current build

**** After you have pushed or made changes ****

Once a build is ready you do an ng build then copy over the whole server folder

Once copied over refresh the website and app-pool and it should be up and running again
